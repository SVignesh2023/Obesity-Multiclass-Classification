# Obesity-Multiclass-Classification
Different models were trained to solve the multiclass classification problem for Obesity problem

Five different models were trained here. These models are:
1) SVM with Linear kernel
2) SVM with Polynomial kernel
3) SVM with RBF kernel
4) Gaussian Naive Bayes
5) Decision Tree (Light GBM)
